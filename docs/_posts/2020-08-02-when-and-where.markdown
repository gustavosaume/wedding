The wedding will be in [Phippsburg, Maine](https://visitmaine.com/places-to-go/midcoast/bath-phippsburg){:target="_blank"} on Friday, August 7th. The venue is a former general store right on the water in West Point, a cute little beachy neighborhood. It's about 10 minutes from Bath, 20 minutes from Brunswick, 45 minutes from Portland.
We are taking a pretty casual approach to this event - more of a weeklong family vacation with a wedding one day. We'll do a lobster bake, have some drinks, hang out by the ocean.

Folks are invited and encouraged to make a mini-vacation of it - it's the best time of year to be in Maine, and there is a ton to do nearby!
